# How does it work

This traffic light is made with the help of PIC16F887 microcontroller, which is mainly used for embedded system. Coming to the working principle of Traffic Lights, the main IC is is used to glow the Red, yellow and green LED respectively and to control all eight 7segments automatically.  Timing of glow of certain lights totally depends upon PIC, which we can control via the push buttons, so if you want to control manually, you can do so by those.
